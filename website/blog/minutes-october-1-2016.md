We discussed the corrected minutes of the May 7, 2016 meeting.  The correction said all properties with meters would pay the repair expenses.  At the time of the meeting all the water users had water meters.  We still have one lot that has water access but no water meter.  The minutes should have read &quot;All water users&quot; will share the expenses of the water system repairs.

Roger explained that Victor &amp; Gloria Miller had agreed to an easement on their property to meet the state requirements before the new well could be put in.  We gave a big &quot;Thank You&quot; to Gloria (for her and Victor) for their willingness to help us in this matter.

Roger updated the status of the new well, and that we should see a well drilling rig soon.  Roger gave us a recap of the area of how it was with Kathy as water operator, and how it is now.  He requested help from others in the area, so we are not relying on just one person to oversee everything.  It is important for others to be involved and then they will know what to do in times of need and they can help relieve stress put on one individual.

Since Roger Bamber now has his water operator&#39;s licence, we discussed payment for him for all his work.  Cindy Goblet made a motion to pay the water operator $250.00 a month, and Gloria Miller seconded the motion.  The motion passed.  We discussed the annual fee.  It was decided that the amount should remain at $25.00, and that tracts with their own well should not be billed the annual fee.  If they want to volunteer to pay it we would appreciate that.

We then voted on officers and board members.  Roger Bamber was elected as President, Mark Kronik was elected to be Vice President, and Marylee Waudby was elected as Secretary/Treasurer.  The board members elected were Paul Morgan, Eric Goblet, and Violet Baldridge.  We also decided that working hours should be 9:00 am to 5:00 pm week days.  We discussed that if water users did not pay their bill 3 times then there should be a charge of $150.00 to have the water turned on (reconnected).  We discussed that we need to be more in line with the city utilities on due dates, and when late fees are due.  It was decided that water bills are to be due on the 1st
 of the month, and late is not paid by the 10th
 of the month (like city utilities).  If a meter has not been used, and at the time they had requested the water meter to be removed (and it was not removed) that we should charge then a $50.00 reconnect fee to turn the water back on for that lot.

After this discussion Roger made a motion that we adjourn the meeting.  Eric Goblet seconded the motion and everyone agreed.  The meeting was closed.
