HOSANNA HEIGHTS WATER DEPARTMENT MINUTES

The meeting was well attended and called to order at 10:05 am by the current president, David White.  Kathy Timlin read the minutes from the last (annual) meeting (October 8, 2015).  The minutes of the October 31, 2015 meeting were not read.  Kathy then gave the treasurer&#39;s report for the past three (3 months) in a hand out.  There was a heated discussion about some of the expenses and serious questions raised about accounting of funds.

Jeff Hutchinson was at the meeting to represent his family&#39;s interest in the area.  He was living here at the time the well was put in and the community was first developed.  He explained that the association was set up as a non-profit for the sole purpose of operating the community water system in order to provide access to clean and safe water for the community.  It was not a property owners association, but the name of the corporation was miss leading and led others to believe that it was a POA when in fact it is not.  This fact was contested, but the evidence and original documents proved otherwise, even though previous administrations operated under the impression that the association was a POA.  That doesn&#39;t change the fact that the association is not a POA.  Another discussion ensued, leading to a motion for a vote of confidence in the current administration to terminate the entire slate of officers and hold new elections.

A motion was made by Debbie Bamber, and seconded by Mark Kronik.  A vote was called and the motion passed by a wide majority of those present.   Kathy Timlin protested the vote and decision, her behavior and foul language was out of control and she would not restrain herself after repeated requests by the community.  She was asked to leave the meeting by everyone in attendance, which she eventually did under an unfortunate animated protest.  She was asked to go get and bring back the to the group all the association records and property; she refused to comply with the reasonable request of the community. Kathy Timlin was told that from this day forward she would never be allowed to hold any position in the of authority with the Hosanna Heights Water Department.

New interim officers/board members were nominated from the floor and elected.  President -Roger Bamber, Secretary/Treasurer â€“ Marylee Waudby and board members are Paul Morgan, Lyle (Jake) Mackey, Joe Haynes, and Carl Horton.  We also agreed to appoint Billy Edwards to oversee the well, since he is certified with the state.

A motion was made by Jeff Hutchinson to dissolve any previous (bylaws) rules and regulations.  It was decided that we would meet again in about three weeks, on May 7, 2016 at 10:00am, at the church building on Timber Ridge Road.  At this next meeting we want all members to bring their ideas for the new rules and regulations.  They will be discussed and we will vote on the rules and regulations.  All we need are some basic rules and regulations that we can all live with.  They will be typed up and notarized so they can be added to the records for the community.

Roger continued the meeting telling us that the well is in bad condition, and about to be shut down by the state.  We started discussion of what our next steps were in correcting the problems.  He told us that we could go as a private well and not be under the state&#39;s control totally.  Roger told us that if we stayed under the VSS that the state had found a grant of $6,000 that we could get and use towards some of the well repairs.   We could try to repair the well or (preferred by the state) put in a new well in a different area to service the area.  It was discussed that putting in a new well at a new location would be too costly, and that we should try to do as much as we can to keep the existing well going.  Our main function is to have good, clean, and safe water for the people who use the water from the well.  There are measures we can do to prevent most of the surface water getting into the well, and those steps will be started.  Roger Bamber and Paul Morgan have volunteered to do the work on the well, but we do have a licensed person (Billy Edwards) to over see the well.  They said that there would be no charge for their work, they just want to help the community.

A motion was made by Roger Bamber, and second by Paul Morgan, that we forgive or dismiss any previous past due water accounts, release leans against properties, drop any legal charges against members and to restore water utility services to disconnected properties, in an effort to establish a clean foundation upon which to build a new water association.  The motion passed unanimously by the residents remaining in attendance.

It was also decided by the remaining residence in attendance that under the new administration and in the future two (2) signatures will be required on all checks written on the Hosanna Heights account and that no one could sign a check for payment to themselves.  All officers will be authorized to sign checks.  The old account would be closed and a new account established as soon as possible, to avoid any misconduct and protect previous administration member&#39;s integrity.

It was decided by the residents remaining in attendance that under the new administration to establish a P. O. Box for the group so that all the association&#39;s mail does not go to an individual&#39;s address.

It was also agreed upon by the residents remaining in attendance that the well should be operated in a manner that fosters community spirit, is seen as a vital asset to the community, helps to attract new residents, and makes access to clean and safe water available to all in the community in an efficient and cost effective manner.  We want this community to be one where the residents are happy, and others are not afraid to buy and live here.

The meeting was concluded and both the old president and the new president went to the bank to see if anything could be done today (Saturday).
