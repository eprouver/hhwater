HOSANNA HEIGHTS WATER DEPARTMENT MINUTES

The meeting was called to order at 10:05 a.m. by the president, Roger Bamber.  The vice president, the minutes from the annual meeting of October 7, 2017 were read, ad the treasurer&#39;s report was given.  The treasurer&#39;s report stated that we had a Three Hundred Thirty Two Dollar net profit for the calendar year 2017.  Handouts were given out to show what the income came from and what the expenses where.  A motion to accept the minutes was made and seconds to accept the minutes.  It was voted to accept the minutes as read.  The current checking account balance as of today is $603.34, and the savings account balance is $2532.81.  We have some bills yet to be paid, Arkansas Rural Water, stamps, sales tax, etc.

It was explained that the board members voted to increase the operator&#39;s pay to help compensate all the extra work that is involved.  Operators, in the past had been paid more, but we just could not afford to pay more when we took over.  Our situation has improved, and the raise would not cause an increase in the water charges.  The operator is now being paid Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per month.  Since we received a grant from the state, they have total control of the well, it&#39;s maintenance, and any thing to do with it.

For old business Roger talked about the problems we are having with the well.  He explained how we have been getting some bad samples.  The people from Little Rock (Arkansas Department of Health) have been up several times checking to see why we are getting bad samples.  We are not under a Boil Water Order because of it, but it must be corrected..  Roger has increased treatment some, and has helped.  They have determined that, since Woolsey did not seal the old well off, the problem must be from it.   One of the specifications the health department had, for the bidding, was for the old well to be sealed.   Roger explained that when we made the change for the testing, so we could get the well hooked up sooner, that the engineer did not write a change order, he rewrote the whole contract.  In doing this he omitted the clause about the sealing of the old well, and therefore Woolsey did not do this.  They claimed it was not in the contract.  There are also some items we have done that were in the contract.  Roger said he is working with then to try to get compensation for that work, and for them to come back and finish other work not completed.  The Arkansas Department of Health is now working to help us get items corrected, with out us having to pay for it (since it was in the original contract).

Before the health department started helping us neither the engineer nor Woolsey would do anything.  Now, with the help of the Arkansas Department of Health we are getting some action.

Roger reported the Eric Goblet had resigned as vice president towards the end of October.  With all the work required by the Arkansas Department of Health the president needs someone to help with the work.  We elected Larry Tucker to be our new vice president.

Having no other business a motion was made by Mark Kronik and second by Larry Tucker to end the meeting.  All agreed and the meeting was closed at 10:50 am.
